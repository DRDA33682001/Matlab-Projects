# Taylor-Maccoll Supersonic Cone Flow Simulation

This MATLAB project solves the Taylor-Maccoll equation to model compressible supersonic flow over a sharp cone. It includes a numerical solver, CSV export, and post-processing visualizations — suitable for academic research or CFD educational purposes.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Numerically solve the Taylor-Maccoll ODEs using 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) integration.
- Compute flow properties (Mach, pressure, temperature, density) behind a conical shock.
- Perform a grid convergence study using different angular step sizes.
- Export flow field data to a CSV file.
- Generate insightful plots from both computed data and CSV.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open `taylor_maccoll_analysis.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to perform the simulation and export CSV results.
3. Open `visualize_flow_csv.m` to generate the post-processing visualizations.
