## üß† Objective

This project implements a numerical solution for **supersonic inviscid compressible flow over a sharp cone** using the **Taylor-Maccoll equation**. The goal is to compute the flow field between a conical shock and the cone surface for a given freestream Mach number and shock angle. It aims to extract key flow quantities such as Mach number, pressure coefficient, cone angle, and thermodynamic state ratios. The output is validated through visual plots and convergence checks.

## üßÆ Mathematical Background

### üìè Oblique Shock Relations

Given:
- \( M_1 \): Freestream Mach number
- \( \theta_s \): Shock wave angle

The **normal Mach number** before the shock is:

\[
M_{n1} = M_1 \sin(\theta_s)
\]

The **normal Mach number after the shock** is:

\[
M_{n2}^2 = \frac{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_{n1}^2}{\gamma M_{n1}^2 - \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}}
\]

The **Mach number after the shock**:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_{n2}}{\sin(\theta_s)}
\]

The **pressure and stagnation pressure ratios**:

\[
\frac{p_2}{p_1} = 1 + \frac{2 \gamma}{\gamma + 1} (M_{n1}^2 - 1)
\]

\[
\frac{p_{02}}{p_{01}} = \left( \frac{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_1^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_2^2} \right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}} \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{-1}
\]

### üìò Taylor-Maccoll Equation

Describes axisymmetric supersonic flow over a cone. The governing ODEs in terms of radial and angular velocity components:

\[
\frac{dV_r}{d\psi} = V_\psi
\]

\[
\frac{dV_\psi}{d\psi} = -\left( \frac{V_r^2 - V_\psi^2}{V_r} + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}(V_r^2 + V_\psi^2 - 1)\frac{V_\psi}{V_r} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( V_r \): Radial velocity component
- \( V_\psi \): Angular velocity component
- \( \psi \): Angle from axis (shock to cone surface)
